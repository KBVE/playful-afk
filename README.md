# AFK

This is an [itch.io](https://kbve.itch.io/afk/) gamejam that is for Playful's Gamejam.
However my plan is to not only build this game for it but also expand it out whenever I need to take a break from Unity.

The basics of this game is simple, you are a leader of a cat but not any random cat, one that will become a god!

The structures will be under the "/afk/nodes/structures" folder and will provide active and passive benefits for your kingdom.
